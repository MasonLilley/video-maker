Am I in the wrong for kicking my brother and his new wife out of my house after they tried to “redecorate” my dead daughter’s room while I was at work? {r/AITAH,Puzzleheaded_Hour966}

So, this is still pretty fresh, and I’m absolutely fuming. For context, I, 38 female, lost my daughter two years ago in a car accident. She was only 14, and ever since that day, I’ve kept her room exactly as she left it. I don’t go in there often, but just knowing that it’s there, untouched, brings me comfort. It’s like having a piece of her still with me. Her posters, her art supplies, her clothes—all of it is still there. I can’t bring myself to change it.

Now, fast forward to a few months ago, my brother, 34 male, and his new wife, 29 female, had some financial issues after blowing a ton of money on a ridiculous, extravagant wedding. They asked if they could stay with me while they saved up for a place. Even though I wasn’t thrilled about it, I agreed because, well, family, right?

At first, things were fine—until recently. I noticed my sister-in-law making comments about how I "shouldn’t keep a shrine" and how it’s “time to move on.” I ignored her because frankly, it’s none of her damn business how I grieve my child. My brother mostly stayed quiet, but I could tell she was getting into his ear.

Anyway, I came home from work last week to a literal nightmare. I walked into my daughter’s room, and I kid you not, THEY HAD TAKEN DOWN ALL HER POSTERS, BOXED UP HER STUFF, AND HAD STARTED REPAINTING THE WALLS A HIDEOUS BEIGE. They had moved in a bunch of generic furniture, hung up new curtains, and were apparently turning it into a guest room. I lost it—screaming, crying, the whole thing. I asked them what the hell they were thinking, and their response? My SIL had the NERVE to tell me they did it as a “favor” to help me “move on” because it was “unhealthy” for me to keep the room as it was.

I was shaking with rage. I told them to pack their stuff and get the hell out of my house immediately. My brother tried to calm me down, saying they meant well and were only trying to help me “let go.” He even tried to make me feel guilty by saying they had nowhere else to go right now, as if that would make me suddenly forgive them for DESTROYING the last piece of my daughter I had left. I told them I didn’t care and that they had crossed an unforgivable line.

Now, my whole family is divided. My parents think I overreacted and say I’m being “heartless” for kicking them out. They keep saying, “They were just trying to help, they didn’t mean any harm,” and that I’m being too harsh because “people grieve differently.” They’re even suggesting I apologize and let them move back in. My brother is still texting me, asking me to reconsider, saying they’re in a tough spot, but all I see when I look at him is betrayal.

So, Am I unreasonable for kicking them out and refusing to even consider letting them back in after what they did?
